# videowiki-uploader

Welcome to the videowiki-uploader Git repository! This project aims to provide a decentralized solution for storing and uploading videos using the Swarm decentralized storage network. This README will guide you through the process of setting up and running the project, explain the advantages of using decentralized storage with Swarm, and provide additional resources for a step-by-step guide and related repositories.

## Why Use Decentralized Storage with Swarm?

Decentralized storage offers several benefits compared to traditional centralized cloud storage solutions:

- **Data Redundancy**: Decentralized storage systems like Swarm store data across a network of nodes, ensuring redundancy and data availability even if some nodes go offline.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Since the storage is distributed and encrypted, it's harder to censor or control the stored content.
- **Security**: Data is encrypted and spread across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Decentralized storage can potentially be more cost-effective than traditional cloud storage, especially for large-scale storage needs.

## Getting Started
